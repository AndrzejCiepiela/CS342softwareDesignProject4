How the game currently works in ths version:

1. Start serverDriverClass and then start as many ClientDriverClasses as you want
2. A client can then challenge another client by pressing that client's button
3. an accept button will appear on client being challenged and when accept is pressed, game begins.
4. multiple games can take place at the same time.
5. Game is one round and when game is over, a quit button appears which currently does nothing but would return player to lobby and can challenge again.

What is still needed:

currently, danny is working on disabling the buttons of the players that are currently playing and having challenger wait for response from challenged
before going into the game.

1. implement a way to return a player back to the lobby after a game is over
2. Help Andrew design/make the GUI look better
3. Test the code for bugs and attempt to fix them.
4. Possibly change the way the list of players is presented and not use buttons. Ask Danny for more info.
5. Anything you think will make the project look better, add it.
6. Any code you think can be improved, change it.
